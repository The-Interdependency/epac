description: Cross-repository coordination for The Interdependency. Load this when a task spans, consumes, compares, publishes to, or can change the contract between two or more repositories; when an agent is about to choose one repo as its workspace for a stack-level problem; when exact producer, evidence-source, skill, semantic, mathematical, or measurement identities must travel together; or when creating a shared stack manifest, multi-repo handoff, coordinated release, or cross-repo validation plan.

# interdependent-work-graph — coordinate the problem, not the folder

Use this procedural skill when the real work graph crosses repository boundaries. Repository boundaries preserve authority, provenance, permissions, and release history. They do not define the limit of one agent's attention.

## Core contract

```text
repository boundary != agent boundary
repository boundary == authority and provenance boundary
```

- Resolve the complete participating graph before choosing where to edit.
- Record exact commits, not only branch names or package availability.
- State what authority each repository or evidence source owns.
- Let one agent coordinate the graph, or let several agents consume the same deterministic graph record.
- Transfer no semantic authority, theorem status, certification status, measurement validity, or empirical status merely because repositories are connected.
- Preserve unresolved mappings and authentication questions as `hmmm`.

## Non-trigger

Do not load this skill merely because a repository has ordinary runtime dependencies. A self-contained patch whose correctness, authority, and validation all remain inside one repository does not require a shared work graph.

Load it when crossing a boundary changes what must be known, preserved, validated, published, or refused.

## Authority model

A participant declares an authority role and a work relation. Common examples:

```text
METAPAT    semantic authority
UCNS       mathematical representation and its own proof/status evidence
EDCM       measurement, projection, and result contracts
skill-lib  reusable build and evidence discipline
corpus     bounded external source evidence
website    publication and presentation consumer
```

These are examples, not a universal fixed list. Read the participating repositories before assigning roles.

## Workflow

1. **Discover the graph.** Identify every repository, package, corpus, schema, workflow, or publication surface whose exact state can change the answer.
2. **Resolve identity.** Pin an exact commit, immutable artifact digest, versioned schema, or explicit `hmmm` for each participant. Moving branch names are navigation aids, not evidence identities.
3. **Assign authority.** State what each participant may define and what it merely consumes.
4. **Declare relations.** Record producer, consumer, evidence source, build-doctrine source, publication target, compatibility peer, or other precise relation.
5. **Declare non-transfer boundaries.** At minimum consider authority, proof status, certification, measurement validity, empirical validity, and user-data permissions.
6. **Choose edit locations.** Patch each claim at its owning source. Do not repair a producer defect by shadowing its schema in a consumer.
7. **Coordinate execution.** Prefer one shared identity record, fixture, or manifest that all agents and workflows consume over separate repo-local reconstructions.
8. **Validate the graph.** Run repository-local gates plus at least one cross-repository fixture or identity check proving that the connected surfaces remain distinct and compatible.
9. **Publish bounded results.** Each PR describes its local changes and cites the shared graph identity. Do not merge dependent consumers before required producers are available.
10. **Carry hmmm forward.** Unknown semantic mappings, signatures, release ordering, or governance choices remain explicit boundary objects.

## Stack-manifest reference contract

The first executable reference shape is:

```json
{
  "schema": "the-interdependency.stack-manifest",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "work_graph_sha256": "<sha256>",
  "repositories": [
    {
      "repository": "owner/name",
      "commit": "<40-hex commit>",
      "authority": "what this participant may define",
      "relation": "how it participates in this work"
    }
  ],
  "boundaries": {
    "authority_transfer": false,
    "proof_status_transfer": false,
    "measurement_status_transfer": false,
    "semantic_mapping": "external-provenance|declared mapping|hmmm",
    "agent_scope": "cross-repository-work-graph",
    "hmmm": []
  }
}
```

The digest is SHA-256 over canonical JSON containing exactly `repositories` and `boundaries`, sorted by key with compact separators. In version 1.0.0 the order of the `repositories` array is itself part of the hashed identity: an emitter lists participants in a declared, stable order, and the same participants in a different order produce a different digest. Key sorting does not reorder arrays, so two agents rebuilding the same graph must consume the emitter's declared order rather than re-discovering it. Consuming implementations may add versioned fields only through an explicit schema revision.

The 1.0.0 `boundaries` block is the minimal machine-carried set. Certification-status and empirical-validity non-transfer are binding obligations of this skill (workflow step 5) even where a 1.0.0 manifest carries no explicit fields for them; explicit `certification_status_transfer` and `empirical_status_transfer` fields arrive through the next schema revision, not through ad-hoc emitter extensions. Non-repository participants (corpus, package, schema, workflow, or publication surfaces) are encoded in 1.0.0 as `repositories` entries whose `authority` and `relation` describe the evidence source; typed participant records are likewise deferred to a schema revision.

A manifest is identity and coordination evidence. It is not cryptographic producer authentication unless a separate signature contract exists.

## Workflow separation

For expensive or generated cross-repository work:

- Pull requests validate read-only whenever possible.
- Materialization is an explicit operation with narrow write permission and a named non-default target branch.
- Generated evidence is sealed once and reused by later agents or workflows rather than independently reconstructed.
- A write-back workflow must not patch source code immediately before claiming to validate that source.
- Repository-specific artifacts include the shared graph identity when their interpretation depends on the graph.

## Output shape

When this skill is active, produce or maintain:

```markdown
## Work graph
- participant: exact identity — authority — relation

## Edit ownership
- repository/path: change and why it belongs there

## Cross-repository boundaries
- no-transfer statements
- permission boundaries
- hmmm

## Validation
- local gates
- shared fixture or manifest check
- release/materialization order
```

For machine-consumed work, also emit the versioned stack manifest or an explicitly named equivalent.

## Repository plan reports and overall portfolio plan

When the question is not one bounded work graph but **what part of the overall effort each self-contained repository owns**, use the repository-report projection rather than inventing a centralized plan document.

Each participating repository owns:

```text
docs/work-graphs/repository-plan-report.json
```

That report states its exact source commit, authority and non-transfer boundaries, portfolio role, current claim, delivered surfaces, active frontier, next actions, blockers, cross-repository relations, machine entrypoints, and `hmmm`.

The frozen input contract is:

```text
interdependent-work-graph/repository-plan-report.schema.json
schema:   the-interdependency.repository-plan-report
version:  1.0.0
blob SHA: 9b347b2dff7692054b571602f30ee6d00c2e7265
```

The deterministic reference aggregator is:

```text
interdependent-work-graph/portfolio_plan.py
```

Its output contract is:

```text
interdependent-work-graph/portfolio-plan.schema.json
schema:  the-interdependency.portfolio-plan
version: 1.0.0
```

Read `interdependent-work-graph/PORTFOLIO_PLAN.md` before producing or changing this projection.

The portfolio plan is a **derived index of repo-owned claims**. It owns no repository canon. Missing or stale repo reports remain visible `hmmm`; do not reconstruct them from memory, package metadata, a neighboring repository, or the aggregator itself. Local checkout paths are excluded from the portfolio identity so the same report set hashes identically across machines.

A repository plan report and a stack manifest are complementary:

```text
repository plan report -> what this repository owns and where its work stands
stack manifest          -> exact identities in one bounded cross-repository work graph
portfolio plan          -> deterministic projection across supplied repo reports
```

## Validation

A successful application demonstrates:

- every participant has an exact or visibly unresolved identity;
- every participant has one stated authority role and work relation;
- no consumer shadows a producer-owned schema or algebra;
- no theorem, semantic, certification, measurement, or empirical status transfers silently;
- the work-graph digest recomputes deterministically;
- repository-local tests pass;
- at least one cross-repository fixture, import, adapter, artifact, or workflow proves the connected path;
- later agents can resume from the graph record without guessing which commits were used.

For the portfolio projection specifically, also require:

- every supplied report validates against the frozen report contract;
- every report pins a source commit and the exact schema blob identity;
- duplicate repository reports fail closed;
- every cross-repository relation carries `authority_transfer: false`;
- report order does not change the derived portfolio identity;
- the portfolio digest excludes machine-local checkout paths;
- missing portfolio members are reported as incompletion rather than synthesized.

## Anti-patterns

- Assigning one AI to one repository when the task's truth conditions span several.
- Treating the currently open repository as the source of every term it imports.
- Installing “latest” dependencies during evidence-producing runs.
- Reimplementing a producer schema or algebra inside a consumer.
- Letting several agents rebuild incompatible local versions of the same evidence.
- Using a digest as though it were a signature.
- Hiding unresolved mappings behind constructor defaults.
- Allowing validation workflows to mutate the source they are validating.
- Copying repo canon into the portfolio plan instead of deriving a report from the owning repository.
- Treating repository discovery or GitHub visibility as automatic portfolio membership.

## Minimal example

A corpus-to-measurement run may bind:

```text
corpus commit     evidence source
skill-lib commit  build/evidence doctrine
METAPAT commit    semantic authority
UCNS commit       mathematical producer
EDCM commit       measurement/artifact producer
```

One agent can follow the complete path. Separate agents can work on different participants if each consumes the same manifest and respects edit ownership.

## hmmm

- The organization-wide persistent service or user interface for live work graphs is not yet selected.
- Content identities do not yet provide cryptographic producer or transport authentication.
- Whether the stack-manifest schema remains a procedural-skill reference contract or later becomes its own metadata-block/schema skill.
- The next stack-manifest schema revision is expected to add explicit `certification_status_transfer` and `empirical_status_transfer` boundary fields, a canonical `repositories` ordering (for example by `repository` then `commit`) in place of declared-order identity, typed non-repository participants with digest/version/schema identities, and an explicit hashed edge list (`from`, `to`, `relation_type`) so distinct work graphs over the same participants cannot share one digest. Version 1.0.0 stays as sealed by the EDCM OEWN 2025 run.
- Cross-repository merge orchestration remains repository-host dependent; the skill defines order and evidence, not a universal transaction mechanism.
- Automatic organization-wide portfolio discovery remains deliberately unselected; explicit report sets preserve intentional membership and visible incompletion.
